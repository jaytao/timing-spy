If every month you were able to perfectly time SPY (SP500) by buying the lowest value,
how much more would you make versus if you were perfectly unlucky and bought at the highest value.

Every month from 1992-01 to 2022-12 you spend 200

Results
```
Best Timing:  246,869.00
Worst TIming: 230,503.69
Striaght Cash: 200 * 30 = 72,000
```

Difference is about 16k which is 7%
